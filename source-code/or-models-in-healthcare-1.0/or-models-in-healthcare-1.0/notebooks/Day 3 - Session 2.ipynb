    "\n",
    "In this case study, you will implement **the maximal coverage location model** to optimize hospital placement in **Northern Baden-Württemberg**. Given a dataset containing:\n",
    "1. **Towns with more than 25,000 inhabitants**, which are potential hospital locations.\n",
    "3. **Travel times (in minutes) between towns** as a measure of accessibility.\n",

    "As a starting point, we assume that the entire hospital network is to be revised and existing locations can be ignored entirely. \n",
    "Your objective is to **model and solve this as a Maximum Coverage Location Problem (MCLP) using SCIP**. This means that:\n",
    "- A **hospital can be built in any town** from the dataset.\n",
    "- A **hospital provides coverage** to the population of a town if it is within a predefined travel time of a town.\n",
    "- The **goal is to place a limited number of hospitals** to **maximize the number of covered towns**.\n",

    "- $ I $ as the set of **potential hospital locations** (indexed by $ i $).\n",

    "- $ a_{ij} $ as a **binary parameter**:\n",
    "  - $ a_{ij} = 1 $ if hospital $ i $ can cover town $ j $ (within a given travel time threshold).\n",
    "  - $ a_{ij} = 0 $ otherwise.\n",
    "- $ w_{j} $ as the population living in town $ j $.\n",
    "- $ y_i $ as a **binary decision variable**:\n",
    "  - $ y_i = 1 $ if a hospital is built in town $ i $.\n",
    "  - $ y_i = 0 $ otherwise.\n",
    "- $ x_j $ as a **binary variable**:\n",
